## 📈 Key Insights

- **Total Revenue Generated:** 456,000  
- **Highest Revenue Category:** Electronics  
- **Highest Average Order Value:** Beauty  
- **Clothing sells the highest total quantity**  
- Female customers slightly outspend male customers overall

## 🗂 Data Modeling Approach

To demonstrate relational database design, the original dataset was normalized into three tables:

- Customers  
- Products  
- Transactions  

JOIN operations were then applied to analyze revenue by demographic and product dimensions, simulating a real-world database environment.
